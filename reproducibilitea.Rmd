### Future directions of travel in FOSS4G

- Integration (e.g. R package qgisprocess, R/Python crossover)
- New approaches, e.g. GeoRust

## The problem - Transport

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/103755051-1b6b2f80-5005-11eb-988b-f7c8d3108e53.png)

Source: ['Inside the black box' report](https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/DocumentCenter/View/755/A-GuideToModeling?bidId=)

--

- Transport models were designed to support growth in car ownership and reduce journey times (Boyce and Williams, 2015)

--

- 21^st^ Century priorities are very different

--

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

--

---

## The solution - Transport

**New technologies mean that open access transport models are possible**

## Open Source Transport Tools

Source: Lovelace (2021), see [github.com/Robinlovelace/open-gat](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/open-gat#open-source-tools-for-geographic-analysis-in-transport-planning)

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/open-access-transport-models/featured_hubc4301c81545b69b038b632d4e46b4cc_72911_720x0_resize_lanczos_2.png)

---

## From open source to open access

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured.png)
- Transport models represent a leverage point in transport systems
- New paper, Lovelace et al (2020) describes the emergence and possibilities for 'open access models'

## What is science?

.pull-left[
- Scientific knowledge is hypotheses that can be falsified
- Science is the process of *generating falsifiable hypotheses* and *testing them*
- In a reproducible way
- Systematically

![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ohhworAhxSEHT3zDa/200w.webp?cid=3640f6095c57e8d15767723367d0c596)
]

--

.pull-right[

- Falsifiability is central to the scientific process `r Citep(my_bib, "popper_logic_1959", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`
- All of which requires software conducive to reproducibility

# Existing products

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tms = readr::read_csv("https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/raw/master/transport-software.csv")[1:5]
tms = dplyr::arrange(tms, dplyr::desc(Citations))
knitr::kable(tms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of transport modelling software in use by practitioners. Note: citation counts based on searches for company/developer name, the product name and 'transport'. Data source: Google Scholar searches, October 2018.", format = "html")

# User support

Getting help is vital for leaning/improving software

# Online communities

- [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions) has 21,314 questions 

- [r-sig-geo](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/) has 1000s of posts

- RStudio's Discourse community has 65,000+ posts already!

--

- No transport equivalent (e.g. earthscience.stackexchange.com is in beta)

- Potential for a Discourse forum or similar: transport is not (just) GIS

# From prototype to deployment

- Example: the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/early.png")
```

---

## Geocomputation in the PCT

- It's all reproducible, e.g.:
- Find commuting desire lines in West Yorkshire between 1 and 3 km long in which more people drive than cycle:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
u = "https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/west-yorkshire/l.geojson"
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = read_sf(u)
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(10, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Set-up, after installing R and checking out www.pct.bike:
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/desire_lines.geojson"
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines = read_sf(u)
```

---

## Visualising data

A fundamental part of data science is being able to understand your data.

That requires visualisation, R is great for that:

.pull-left[
```{r, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plot(desire_lines)
```

]

.pull-right[
- Interactively:

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(desire_lines) + tm_lines("all")
```

]

---

## Processing data with code

- Now we have data in our computer, and verified it works, we can use it

- Which places are most car dependent? 

```{r}
car_dependent_routes = desire_lines %>% 
  mutate(percent_drive = car_driver / all * 100) %>% 
  filter(rf_dist_km < 3 & rf_dist_km > 1) 
```

---

## Checking the results:

```{r}
b = c(0, 25, 50, 75)
tm_shape(car_dependent_routes) +
  tm_lines(col = "percent_drive", lwd = "all", scale = 5, breaks = b, palette = "-inferno")
```

# Get involved

- Support open source solutions indirectly
  - Sign-up to platforms for sharing and collaborating on open source projects, such as https://github.com/
  - Preferentially use, cite and endorse open access and open source solutions
  - Find the open source tool best suited to your needs and communicate constructively with the developers
  - Communicate ways to improve open source solutions, e.g. by commenting on 'issue trackers' on forums such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Download, install and play with open source software
  - R/RStudio, great for data analysis but also interactive visualisation and, increasingly, [transport planning workflows](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)
  - Have a play with open access transport tools such as [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/#ab-street) and the [PCT](https://www.pct.bike/), which can run on your computer or in the browser
