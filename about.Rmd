# Introduction

- A bit about me + research:

--

- Geographer (BSc 2008) and Environmental Scientist (MSc 2009) by training

--

- Interest in energy led to PhD in transport (PhD in energy costs of commuting [2014](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5027/))
- Limitations of [GUIs](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1129404652150243329) for modelling -> Spatial Microsimulation with R ([2016](https://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net/))
- Co-authored Efficient R Programming ([2016](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/))
- Lead Developer of Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) ([2017](https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/862))
- Co-author of Geocomputation with R ([2019](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html))

--

- Turing Fellowship + [Data Science Fellowship at N. 10](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/esrc-adr-uk-no-10-data-science-fellowships-2021/) (18 months, 80% FTE)
- LIDA internship on open transport infrastructure data
- Link with DfT, MHCLG, TfNH, international partners

--

- Future areas of development: Reproducible Bayesian modelling of proportions (Dirichlet regression), Machine Learning, Decarbonisation Agenda
