<!-- WORKSHOP TITLE: Open Science in Transport: Challenges and Opportunities in a COVID-19 Era -->
<!-- DATE and TIME: January 21st, 2020 / 2:00PM-5:00PM (EST) / 20:00-23:00 (CET)  -->
<!-- ORGANISED BY: TRB International Coordinating Council - ICC (A0020C) -->
<!-- SPONSORED BY: TRB Committees AED10, AED20, AED70, AJE35, AJE45, AJE70 -->
<!-- DESCRIPTION: Open Science (OS) is a modern movement that represents a new approach to practicing science in a way that increases openness, integrity and reproducibility of research. We will discuss challenges and opportunities brought by Open Science in transport research, in particular in the COVID-19 context, and how to achieve a common understanding on the practical impact of Open Science in the transport sector. -->

<!-- Timing: -->

<!-- Part I â€“ Setting the scene (65 min) 19:00 - 20:05 -->
<!-- Break - 20:05 - 20:30 -->

<!-- Part II â€“ Some examples of OS in Transport (45mn) 20:30 - 21:45 -->
<!-- Data, open access & open innovation -->
<!-- 3 to 4 pre-recorded presentations (7 to 10mn) + audience participation with Q/A (10 mn) -->

<!-- 1- Transport data  -->
<!--     â—¦ Open data: key challenges for transport data collection and management, Speaker from OECD-ITF (TBC)  -->
<!-- 2- Transport results in open access  -->
<!--     â—¦ Open access results on the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on transport: a collection of articles, prof. Karst Geurs, University of Twente, The Netherlands, ETRR Editor-in-Chief  -->
<!--     â—¦ Open access transport models: a leverage point in sustainable transport planning, Robin Lovelace, ITS Leeds and WCTRs  -->
<!-- 3- Open innovation in road and transport research -->
<!--     â—¦ The case study in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mark Henry Rubarenzya, Head - Research and Development, Directorate of Network Planning and Engineering â”‚Uganda National Roads Authority  -->
<!-- I'll be 'on' around 21:00 -->

## The problem

--

- Transport models were designed to support growth in car ownership and reduce journey times (Boyce and Williams, 2015)

--

- 21^st^ Century priorities are very different

--

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

--

## The solution

**New technologies mean that open access transport models are possible**

## The paper

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured_hu0c285bfa775f060af938f28c962ce470_79909_808x455_fill_lanczos_smart1_2.png)
- Transport models represent a leverage point in transport systems
- New paper, Lovelace et al (2020) describes the emergence and possibilities for 'open access models'

# Get involved

- Support open source solutions indirectly
  - Sign-up to platforms for sharing and collaborating on open source projects, such as https://github.com/
  - Preferentially use, cite and endorse open access and open source solutions
  - Find the open source tool best suited to your needs and communicate constructively with the developers
  - Communicate ways to improve open source solutions, e.g. by commenting on 'issue trackers' on forums such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Download, install and play with open source software
  - R/RStudio, great for data analysis but also interactive visualisation and, increasingly, [transport planning workflows](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)
  - Have a play with open access transport tools such as [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/#ab-street) and the [PCT](https://www.pct.bike/), which can run on your computer or in the browser
