## Bio

I'm an Associate Professor of Transport Data Science at the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) with research interests ranging from optimal zoning systems for urban analysis to analysis of road safety data. I have experience not only researching but deploying transport models in inform sustainable policies, and have used R heavily in my role as Lead Developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (see www.pct.bike), an open source and open access tool used by dozens of transport authorities to support evidence-based design of strategic cycle networks. I'm also a keen R user, developer and teacher, author of [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) and several R packages.

### Climate change: The elephant in the room

What is climate change? And how does it related to open source software?


It's great to be able to talk about climate change upfront. Usually it's behind the scenes.

To solve problems you need to talk about them.

Everyone including the elephant knows that climate change means the world is getting warmer.

But fewer people talk about 'global drying' and likely impacts such as sudden sea level rise that can only be described as catastrophic

As with health, the most solutions tackle the root causes of the problem. So what is the root cause of the problem? We can go back a few steps...

Climate change is caused by emissions.

Emissions are (primarily) caused by combustion of fossil fuels

But what causes that? Energy consumption.

What causes energy use? Demand for energy intensive things, transport, manufacturing

## Example: Climate change, what data science can bring

Emotive and potentially polarising issue

Data can provide a shared starting point

Nationally scenarios are vital

Locally, visions, trust, buy-in and participation are key

The Downward trend during coronavirus saw emissions drop by ~10%

The scale of the challenge is to reduce emissions by 10% every year, every year, and the challenge gets hard with each year

That means: we need transformational

That means: we need transformational change, we need to be on a war footing

# Root causes: scarcity and fear

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/H3I974qpIYExy" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/boybandabc-boy-band-eyebrow-raise-H3I974qpIYExy">via GIPHY</a></p>

???

That may sound counter-intuitive given that we have an over-supply of fossil fuels

But it's a sense of scarcity that makes people move from being economic satisficers to maximers

And a sense of scarcity is driven by fear - so an important response to climate change is to not respond fearfully but optimistically

Consumption is often portrayed as a bottom-up process but in fact it's largely top-down: people who have too much wanting more, dedicating their lives to increasing their share of the pie

In a society where people have a sense of abundance, there will be fewer people who feel the need to accumulate and compete
