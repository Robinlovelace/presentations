## Updates to county level statistics

-   Note: number of trip to be updated

## Sampling cycleways as tourist trip origins/destinations

## Results: National cycle tourism (fastest network)

## Notes on modelling approach

-   identifying destinations for recreational trips

    -   cycleways (Greenways, EuroVelo, Sports Ireland and OSM)
    -   tourism nodes from Geodirectory (e.g. campsites)
    -   green spaces from OSM

## Notes on modelling II

-   simulating trips to destinations

    -   number of trips: 5 recreational cycle trips per 100 people (from PAG Unit 13 - see link in recreational.Rmd)
    -   turn destinations into point layer
    -   assign destination weights
    -   intra-county and inter-county trips

-   routing

-   validation <!-- -   strava -->

## Next steps: Phase 2

-   Update to include new Census results
-   New POWSCAR data [available from 2023](https://www.cso.ie/en/census/census2022/powscar/)
-   Updates to User Interface
-   Improvements to make the contributions and additions easier
    -   Refactor the codebase
    -   Open source the codebase
    -   Building a community of contributors
-   Training and community building

## Feedback, Q&A, discussion

-   Does the network in your home County look reasonable?
-   Are the visualisations clear and appropriate?
-   How do you envisage using the CRUSE tool in your work?
-   Is anything missing?
