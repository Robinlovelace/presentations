  abstract = {Reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific research, because the credibility of science is at stake when research is not reproducible. Like science, the development of good, reliable scientific software is a social process. A mature and growing community relies on the R software environment for carrying out geoscientific research. Here we describe why people use R and how it helps in communicating and reproducing research.},
