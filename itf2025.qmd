## Introduction

-   **Who am I?** Professor of Transport Data Science at the University of Leeds.
-   **My focus:** Building open, reproducible, and policy-relevant transport planning tools.
-   **Today's topic:** Building *capacity* for data-driven decision-making in urban mobility.
-   **Why it matters for Southeast Europe:** Supporting sustainable mobility goals and the path to EU collaboration.

::: notes
Thank you for the introduction and the invitation to speak. It's an honour to be here to open this important conference.

My work is all about bridging the gap between data science and transport policy. I believe that by building capacity through open and transparent methods, we can make better, more equitable decisions about how our cities move.

This is especially relevant for the countries of Southeast Europe, which are at a critical juncture in developing their urban mobility systems. The principles I'll discuss today can help build a strong foundation for evidence-based policymaking and support wider European integration.

## The Challenge: The Data-to-Policy Gap

We have more data than ever before, but are we using it effectively?

**Common Barriers:**

-   **Data Access:** Data is often siloed, proprietary, or not in a usable format.
-   **Skills & Tools:** Lack of training and accessible tools to analyse the data.
-   **Institutional Culture:** Resistance to new methods and a disconnect between analysts and decision-makers.
-   **Procurement:** Over-reliance on 'black box' commercial solutions.

::: notes
This is a challenge we see everywhere, not just in transport and not just in Southeast Europe. We are drowning in data but starving for wisdom.

The key barriers are often not technical, but institutional and cultural. How do we get the right data, to the right people, with the right tools, in a way that is trusted and understood by policymakers?

Furthermore, traditional procurement models often lock public authorities into expensive, inflexible, and opaque software. This hinders capacity building and innovation.

::: notes
An open approach is the foundation for building sustainable capacity. It's not just about free software. It's about creating a transparent ecosystem of data, tools, and knowledge.

When methods are open, they can be scrutinized, validated, and improved by the community. This builds trust in the results.

When educational resources like our book, "Geocomputation with R", are open access, they lower the barrier for people to learn these vital skills, which is the essence of capacity building.

## Pillar 1: Open Data & Standards

Good analysis starts with good data.

-   **Data Standards are Key:**
    -   GTFS for public transport schedules.
    -   GBFS for shared micro-mobility (bikes, scooters).
    -   OpenStreetMap for detailed street network data.
-   **National Data Portals:** A vital resource for official statistics and geographic data.
-   **Example:** Sourcing road network data from OpenStreetMap for a whole country.

::: notes
TODO: Find examples of open data portals in Southeast European countries.

The first step in building data analytics capacity is to get a handle on the data itself. Adopting international standards like GTFS and GBFS is crucial. It makes data interoperable and allows you to use a wide range of existing open-source tools.

OpenStreetMap is an incredibly powerful, free resource for detailed transport network data, which is often more up-to-date than official sources. We can build a model of an entire country's transport network in minutes using OSM.
:::

## Pillar 2: Open Source Tools

Powerful, free, and adaptable tools for transport analysis.

-   **The R & Python Ecosystems:** Mature, extensive libraries for data science, statistics, and visualisation.
-   **Example (R):** The `stplanr` package for transport planning and modelling.
-   **Example (Python):** `geopandas` and `pandana` for network analysis.
-   These tools can be adapted to local needs and data sources.

![](images/seville-flowmap.png)

::: notes
You don't need expensive, proprietary software to do high-quality transport analysis. The open-source ecosystems in R and Python provide everything you need.

Packages like `stplanr` in R allow you to do complex tasks like analysing origin-destination data, building transport models, and calculating accessibility metrics.

The image shows an analysis of travel patterns in Seville, Spain, done entirely with open-source tools and open data. This kind of analysis is reproducible and can be adapted to any city where you have the necessary data. This is a key part of building institutional capacity.

## Pillar 3: Communities of Practice

Capacity building is not just about tools, it's about people.

-   A 'Community of Practice' is a group of people who "share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly" [@wenger1998].
-   Open source projects naturally foster these communities.
-   Examples: rOpenSci, rOpenSpain, QGIS user groups.
-   They provide support, share best practices, and drive innovation.
-   **Key takeaway:** To build capacity, invest in building communities.

## Case Study 1: National-Scale Planning (UK)

From local data to national strategy with `plan.activetravelengland.gov.uk`.

-   **Purpose:** Prioritise billions of £ in investment for walking and cycling.
-   **How it works:**
    -   Integrates dozens of open datasets (e.g., census, road safety, network data).
    -   Uses a transparent, open-source model (`pct` R package).
    -   Provides a web interface for planners across the country.
-   **Impact:** A consistent, evidence-based approach to national transport planning.

::: notes
This is a real-world example of building capacity at a national level. Active Travel England, a government agency, needed a way to make fair and effective decisions about where to invest in active travel infrastructure.

We built a tool that combines multiple data sources into a single, accessible platform. Because the methodology is open, local authorities can understand, trust, and even challenge the recommendations.

This demonstrates how a national body can empower local and regional planners, building capacity across the entire system.

## Case Study 2: Regional Planning (Scotland)

The Network Planning Tool ([npt.scot](https://npt.scot)).

-   **Purpose:** Help regional and local authorities design and prioritise active travel networks.
-   **Features:**
    -   Open data and transparent methods.
    -   Estimates of cycling potential and Level of Service.
    -   Web UI for planners and the public.
-   **Lesson:** A powerful tool can be developed and deployed for a specific region, and can serve as a model for others.

::: notes

[add content here for Robin to input: What was the budget for this tool? How long did it take to develop? This would be useful context for the audience.]

The key takeaway is that these tools are not just for analysis; they are for collaboration. They provide a common evidence base that planners, politicians, and the public can use to have a more informed conversation about the future of their transport networks.

## Case Study 3: National OD data in Spain

-   The `spanishoddata` package provides access to Spain's national origin-destination mobility survey.
-   It's a community-driven project, adopted by **rOpenSpain**, ensuring long-term maintenance and quality.
-   The tool is used by researchers and public bodies, including the **Spanish Ministry of Transport**, for evidence-based planning.
-   This demonstrates a successful model of collaboration between government, academia, and the open-source community.

::: notes
This is another great example of building capacity through open, collaborative tools. The government releases the data, and the community builds the tools to make it accessible and useful. This creates a virtuous cycle, where better tools lead to more use of the data, which in turn justifies the continued release and improvement of the data.

## Making it Happen in Southeast Europe

How can you apply these principles?

1.  **Start with a Data Audit:** What data do you have? What format is it in? What can be opened?
2.  **Run a Pilot Project:** Choose a specific problem (e.g., mapping cycling potential in one city) and solve it with open tools.
3.  **Invest in Training:** Build skills in R or Python for spatial data analysis within your statistical offices and transport authorities.
4.  **Foster Regional Collaboration:** Share data, code, and experiences with neighbouring countries facing similar challenges.

::: notes
The journey starts with a single step. You don't need to build a national-level tool overnight.

A great first step for a National Statistics Institution is to conduct a thorough audit of existing transport-related data. See what can be standardized and published as open data.

A pilot project is a fantastic way to demonstrate the value of these methods and build momentum. It provides a tangible success story that can be used to justify further investment in capacity building.

Collaboration is key. Events like this are a perfect opportunity to build the networks that will support a regional community of practice.

## Future Directions: New Data & New Challenges

The landscape is always changing.

-   **New Data Sources:** Mobile phone data, GPS tracks, sensor data offer huge potential.
    -   Companies can be paid or mandated to share anonymised data for public good, e.g. mobile network operators.
-   **New Challenges:**
    -   **Quality & Bias:** Are these new datasets representative?
    -   **Privacy & Ethics:** How do we use sensitive data responsibly?
    -   **Governance:** Who owns the data and the insights?
-   **New tools** provide new ways to add value to existing datasets

::: notes
As we look to the future, we see exciting new data sources. But these come with serious challenges, as will be discussed in Session 3 of this conference.

We must be 'critical data scientists' and ask hard questions about bias, privacy, and ethics. Who is left out of these new datasets? How can we ensure that data-driven decisions are equitable?

Techniques like jittering, which adds random noise to location data, can help. But technology is only part of the solution. We need strong governance and ethical frameworks. This is a key area where statistical offices have a vital role to play.
