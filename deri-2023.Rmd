# Data can make a difference

Where I am now: PCT used by many in government

### Too much data?

A nice problem to have?

Data historically a limiting factor

New approaches needed to tackle 'big noise'

- For most of the history of transport planning data scarcity has been a major concern
- Now we have an abundance of datasets, many of them incompatible
- Concrete example: OD to WPZ data in central London (could ask if anyone knows, it's a mess hehe)

#### Problems worthy of your time

# Existing tools: The Propensity to Cycle Tool

- Early prototype of the tool developed at Open Data Institute Leeds hackathon, 2015
- National deployment of the Propensity to Cycle Tool 2 years later ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```

## Key aspects of the PCT

- Based on open source code
- Based on open data
- Results published as open data
- Publicly available web application encourages participation and evidence-based debate

Open data and accessible results lead to participation. See https://twitter.com/search?q=cyipt.bike%2Frapid

### The future of transport tools

Modular

Future proof

Scalable

```

Approach: OD -> Desire Line -> Route -> Route Networks

???

So what's the overall approach here?
