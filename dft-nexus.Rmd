# Data can make a difference

???

- But only after skillful data science techniques add value to it, enabling it to answer questions and to reveal the true nature of the world, based on the data
- Paraphrasing Bayesian statistician John Kruschke, the role of the data analyst is to make people change their minds, and resulting decisions, based on the data
- It's about evidence-based policy: sometimes it seems that data science is about making pretty visualisations and bragging about how big your dataset or your neural network is. It's not. It's about updating prior beliefs to re-align them with the true nature of the world, based on the data.
- That is a powerful concept that can make decision-making less ideological, debate more harmonious, and resulting policies much more effective.
- The example shows me presenting the national Propensity to Cycle Tool at the opening of the new ITS building a few minutes walk up the road
- It shows how data can lead to less polarised and more harmonious debate: although we may have different world-views, we can both agree that the data suggests that there is high cycling potential along this particular road in his constituency, and that there should probably be a cycleway there.

## PCT Results: baseline

- A problem: a lot of academic work is rather high level and general, while transport policies often require highly specific and localised interventions.
- 250 to 500 commuter cyclists using that bit, up to around 1k/day all purposes

Another issue is that models tend to reinforce policies that maintain the status quo

- We can use models to represent bold policies of where we want to get to

## Results on the ground

![](http://www.happycyclist.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shans2-768x432.jpg)

"Work started in September 2020 on the A660 Otley Road to implement cycling between St Anne's Road / A6157 (Headingley) and Victoria Road and in February 2021 for Hyde Park Corner to St Marks Road."

I am an all-round data scientist with experience with Python, Julia, and command line tools such as Docker and shell scripting for scalable data science applications.

I have particular expertise in R and geocomputation with R in particular.
