## What is this talk about?

This talk will introduce *Geocomputation with R*, a new book on using R to work with geographic data.
It covers some of the key contents from the book and provide some examples of what is possible when geographic datasets are approached from a 'data science' perspective, that ensures reproducibility.
I'll show how working with geographic data has become much easier and more user friendly over the years, and demonstrate the importance of geographic data for informing policy.

## What is Geocomputation?


.pull-left[

> GeoComputation is about using the various different types of geodata and about developing relevant geo-tools within the overall context of a 'scientific' approach `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/s.openshaw/s.openshaw.png")
```
]

--

- But we do differ from early definitions in one important way:

> At the turn of the 21st Century it was unrealistic to expect readers to be able to reproduce code examples, due to barriers preventing access to the necessary hardware, software and data `r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2019", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`

---

## Other aspects of the definition

--

> What distinguishes geocomputation from the older quantitative geography, is its emphasis on "creative and experimental" GIS applications `r Citep(my_bib, "longley_geocomputation_1998", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

It's about doing "practical work that is beneficial or useful" `r Citep(my_bib, "openshaw_geocomputation_2000", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

> about harnessing the power of modern computers to *do things* with geographic data.

## Context

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** have become immensely popular and now they are a part of the **tidyverse**
- These packages use the 'tidy data' principles for consistency and speed of processing (from `vignette("tidy-data")`):


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

## Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*

## A brief history of geographic data in R

R's predecesor was S, which was itself inspired by lisp `r Citep(my_bib, "chambers_extending_2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

This is geographic analysis in S `r Citep(my_bib, "rowlingson_splancs_1993", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`:

```
pts <- spoints(scan('cavities'))
uk()
pointmap(pts,add=T) 
zoom()
uk(add=T) 
pointmap(pts,add=T)
poly<-getpoly() 
```

Still works today, 25 years later:

```{r}
library(splancs)
#> Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Code in S-Plus
#> Version 2 - Spatial and Space-Time analysis
```

---

## Live demo (try this)!

```{r, fig.height=4}
# install.packages("splancs"); library(splancs)
# example, interactive! (commented bits)
data(bodmin)
plot(bodmin$poly, asp=1, type="n")
pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
# zoom()
# pointmap(as.points(bodmin), add=TRUE)
```

---

## Observations
- R' is robust and future-proof 

- See a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luxllb_WAqY) of Roger Bivand's talk on the subject (live demo of R 0.49) + GitHub [repo](https://github.com/rsbivand/eRum18/blob/master/eRum_keynote_18.Rmd)

- Rs capabilities have evolved substantially since then!

---

## A brief history of geographic data viz in R

"The core R engine was not designed specifically for the display and analysis
of maps, and the limited interactive facilities it offers have drawbacks in this
area" `r Citep(my_bib, "bivand_applied_2013", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

--

Five years later...

--

"An example showing R's flexibility and evolving geographic capabilities is **leaflet**
`r Citep(my_bib, "R-leaflet", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`,
a package for making interactive maps that has been extended by the R community, as we'll see in Chapter 9" 
`r Citep(my_bib, "lovelace_geocomputation_2018", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))`.

---

## Base R graphics: sf 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
plot(nz)
```

--

## tmap

- A diverse dedicated mapping R package

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_polygons("Median_income", palette = "RdYlBu")
```

---

## Summary: recent packages for spatial data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The **tidyverse** now (mostly) works with spatial data.

This is thanks to **sf**, a recent package (first release in 2016) that implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

Raster data is also supported, in the more mature package **raster**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("raster")
```


For datasets...:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

## Reproducibility + collaboration

> Collaboration is most important aspect of science (and reprex the most important R package!) (Jakub Nowosad, 2018, GEOSTAT)

<br> Slides: https://geocompr.github.io/presentations/
<br> Source code: https://github.com/geocompr/geostats_18

```{r, eval=FALSE}
reprex::reprex(2 + 2)
```

``` r
2 + 2
#> [1] 4
```

<sup>Created on 2018-10-30 by the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) (v0.2.1)</sup>

Attaching packages

```{r}
library(sf)
library(raster)
```

---

## Issue: Conflicting function names

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r}
library(sf)
f = system.file(package = "spData", "shapes/world.shp")
world_sf = read_sf(f)
```

`write_sf()/st_write()` writes data `st_write(prague_sf, 'data/prague_sf.gpkg')`. See supported formats with: `sf::st_drivers()`. Details: Chapter 6 of our book: [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r}
library(spData) # we'll use our own data
class(world)
world
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# ---
## Structure of the sf objects
# world$name_long
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# world$name_long[1:3]
# ```
# 
# ```{r, eval=FALSE}
# world$geom
# ```
# 
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# print(world$geom, n = 3)
```

---

## Attribute operations: filtering

```{r, warning=FALSE}
world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "United Kingdom")
```

--

Base R equivalent:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
```

--

Question:

```{r}
identical(
  world %>% filter(name_long == "United Kingdom"),
  world[world$name_long == "United Kingdom", ]
) # ?
```

---

## Aggregation

```{r}
world_cont = world %>% 
        group_by(continent) %>% 
        summarize(pop_sum = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world_cont, n = 1)
```


- The `st_set_geometry` function can be used to remove the geometry column:

```{r}
world_df = st_set_geometry(world_cont, NULL)
class(world_df)
```

---

## Spatial operations

It's a big topic which includes:

- Spatial subsetting
- Spatial joining/aggregation
- Topological relations
- Distances
- Spatial geometry modification
- Raster operations (map algebra)

See [Chapter 4](http://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html) of *Geocomputation with R* 

---

## Spatial subsetting

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
lnd_buff = lnd[1, ] %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 27700) %>%  # uk CRS
  st_buffer(500000) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
near_lnd = world[lnd_buff, ]
plot(near_lnd$geom)
```

- What is going with the country miles away?

---

## Multi-objects

Some objects have multiple geometries:

```{r}
st_geometry_type(near_lnd)
```

Which have more than 1?

```{r}
data.frame(near_lnd$name_long,
           sapply(near_lnd$geom, length))
```

---

## Subsetting contiguous polygons

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6}
near_lnd_new = world %>% 
  st_cast(to = "POLYGON") %>% 
  filter(st_intersects(., lnd_buff, sparse = FALSE))
plot(st_geometry(near_lnd_new))
```

---

## CRS: a key geo* concept

```{r}
na_2163 = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") %>% 
  st_transform(2163) #US National Atlas Equal Area
st_crs(na_2163)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
na = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") 
png('slides/figs/coord_compare.png', width = 1000, height = 250)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(na[0]);plot(na_2163[0])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/coord_compare.png)

---

## Making maps

- Basic maps of `sf` objects can be quickly created using the `plot()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world[0])
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(world["pop"])
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
png('slides/figs/plot_compare.png', width = 800, height = 300)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar=c(0,0,1,0))
plot(world[0]);plot(world["pop"])
dev.off()
```

![](figs/plot_compare.png)

---

## tmap

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("plot") #check the "view"
tm_shape(world, projection = "+proj=moll") +
        tm_polygons("lifeExp", title = "Life expactancy",
          style = "pretty", palette = "RdYlGn") +
        tm_style("grey")
```

---
## leaflet

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(world) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp),
                    popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(widgetframe)
library('leaflet')
l = leaflet(world) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5, fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp), popup = paste(round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
frameWidget(l, height = '400')
```

---

## What about raster data?

Raster data in R is evolving:

- You can convert vector data to the `Spatial*` form using `as(my_vector, "Spatial")`before working on raster-vector interactions
- There are some initial efforts to bring raster data closer to the **tidyverse**/**sf** approaches, such as [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster), or [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize)
- [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) focusses on multidimensional space-time (raster/vector) is evolving.
- **[terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra)** - first release expected early 2019

## 'Leverage points' where R skills can help

A few examples:

--

- Visualising data: e.g [geoplumber](http://www.geoplumber.com/)

--

- To the public - web viz pkgs help with that!

--

- Local issues. E.g. where's the most dangerous/unpopular road in Hamburg?

--

- Community cohesion

--


Challenge: balance between innovation and tool overload


Challenge: balance between transparency/simplicity and sophistication of analysis


That is a balance R is ideally set-up to strike
