## The problem

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/103755051-1b6b2f80-5005-11eb-988b-f7c8d3108e53.png)

Source: ['Inside the black box' report](https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/DocumentCenter/View/755/A-GuideToModeling?bidId=)

--

- Black boxes obfuscate methods, reduce trust in research, stifle innovation and reduce the ability of future work to build on (and cite) your research

--

- Academic research was developed at a time when computers, let alone open source software and reproducible code, were available: black boxes are the norm

---

### The solution: get your code out there

## Preparing code for publication

.pull-left[

#### At a minum

- Code hosting website (e.g. GitHub)
- Good README with instructions to run code (+optional badges)
- Minimum example (synthetic?) input dataset
- Clear directory structure
- Select and follow a style guide
<!-- - Identify a style guide you like and stick to it -->
- Small readable 'chunks' (functions/scripts)

#### Advanced

- Active issue tracker
- Packaging + documentation
- Code review
- Continuous integration
- Community chat (e.g. discord)

]

### Example: stplanr

## Beyond code 1: dissemination

## Beyond code 2: open access tools

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured.png)

- Outlines 'network effects' of open research and putting things 'out there'
- Conclusion: open access is particularly important for policy relevant research

## Case study of publishing code

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/150165206-d7f4e45b-eebb-4f10-a458-2fe8b146ba36.png)

Code processing confidential data hosted online: https://github.com/npct/pct-scripts/blob/master/03.2_school_prepare_OD_file.R

---

## Aggregate outputs published

- We commissioned a dataset from DfE, sensitive data, processed securely
- Open code and (more importantly) aggregated derived data increased impact

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/150166166-511aba5b-1ac6-4aa1-a623-d98953d34d7a.png)

### Skills and lessons learned along the way

.pull-left[

### Skills

General 

- Communication (beyond usual ppl)
- Forward planning
- Agile workflow

Technical

- Version control (Git/GitHub)
- Kanban boards
- Receiving feedback on code
- Integrating manuscript prose + code, with RMarkdown and Quarto

]

.pull-right[


### Lessons

- Get collaborators onboard

<!-- Talk about working with many people -->

- Don't be afraid to publish 'unfinished' code

- Publishing code and contributing online can lead to surprising benefits
  - E.g. link with Italian PhD student and paper
- Ask questions of the *community*

#### Beyond code 3: Community engagement

Sharing code happens in context of open source communities

They are usually friendly communities

Getting involved can lead to collaborations
