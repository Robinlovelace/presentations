## Overview

#### 1 Introduction to policy need and current evidence

- Local knowledge
- The [Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)](https://www.pct.bike/)

## The Propensity to Cycle Tool + Filling Gaps

In many ways the PCT was first conceptualised in Sheffield

At the time I saw it as an algorithm that would tell you where to build the 'next' cycleway

Pennistone Road, London Road, Eccleshall Road

Over time I realised that it's not that simple: what we really need is joined-up networks

In a way new tools have allowed us to go full circle and prioritise

Some LSOA zones are 5+ km wide!

Developed for a very specific purpose

## Prioity links in Rapid

Which criteria to use?

- Road width
- Segment length
- Presence of spare lanes
- Cycling levels (based on current of scenario levels of cycling)

William Stewart mentioned in the plenary session that there were plans for London Road

## The ActDev tool

4 month UKRI funded project on high impact research in transport/planning

Publicly prototype tool on potential and provision around new developments

Vital for filling gaps in rural networks in proximity to rural networks

But also raises the question: should we be encouraging people to live in car dependent locations?
