<!-- This talk will outline to key concepts and products that will increasingly support evidence based transport planning and cost effective investment of public funds in the 21st Century, open source tools and open access models. Building on two recently published papers on the concepts, in the journal Transport Policy in 2020 and in the Journal of Geographical Systems in 2021, the talk will explore the concepts, demonstrate some evolving new tools and discuss future avenues of research and development. Open tools/models ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid `reinventing the wheel' and focus on innovation, the â€˜gamifiedâ€™ A/B Street software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The talk discusses how to realise the great potential of new approaches to generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that are needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century. -->

<!-- Bio: -->

<!-- Robin Lovelace is Associate Professor of Transport Data Science at the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) specialising in the analysis of regional transport systems and modelling scenarios of change. Robin has experience not only researching but deploying transport models in inform sustainable policies and more effective use of transport investment, notably as Lead Developer of the Propensity to Cycle Tool (see www.pct.bike). Robin is also the Principal Investigator of the Department for Transport funded SaferActive project and author of popular open source software packages (such as stplanr) and books including Geocomputation with R. -->


## The problem

--

- Transport models were designed to support growth in car ownership and reduce journey times (Boyce and Williams, 2015)

--

- 21^st^ Century priorities are very different

--

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

## The solution

**New technologies mean that open access transport models are possible**

## Open Source Transport Tools

## From open source to open access

![](https://www.robinlovelace.net/publication/lovelace-open-2020/featured.png)
- Transport models represent a leverage point in transport systems
- New paper, Lovelace et al (2020) describes the emergence and possibilities for 'open access models'

# Get involved

- Support open source solutions indirectly
  - Sign-up to platforms for sharing and collaborating on open source projects, such as https://github.com/
  - Preferentially use, cite and endorse open access and open source solutions
  - Find the open source tool best suited to your needs and communicate constructively with the developers
  - Communicate ways to improve open source solutions, e.g. by commenting on 'issue trackers' on forums such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- Download, install and play with open source software
  - R/RStudio, great for data analysis but also interactive visualisation and, increasingly, [transport planning workflows](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/)
  - Have a play with open access transport tools such as [A/B Street](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/#ab-street) and the [PCT](https://www.pct.bike/), which can run on your computer or in the browser
