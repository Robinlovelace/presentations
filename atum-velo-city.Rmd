Abstract: **Free, open source and participatory planning tools for prioritising
cycling interventions: a call for conversation and an international
community of practice:  Robin Lovelace, Rosa Félix, Lake Sagaris**

Transport planning tools of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century were designed
primarily to support motorized transport (Boyce and Williams 2015). This
observation suggests that new approaches to transport planning maybe
needed support sustainable transport planning in general, and designing
for cycling, a mode with very different (and diverse) characteristics
compared with driving (Parkin 2018). Increasingly, issues of social
justice and gender have come to the fore, leading to tools that are
better able to cater for the needs of both cycle network planners and
society at large (e.g. Larsen, Patterson, and El-Geneidy 2013; Lovelace
et al. 2017; Raffler, Brezina, and Emberger 2019). Recent advances in
hardware, software and data sources have helped, but many new tools
still contain features that are proprietary, opaque and impenetrable to
the public. ‘Black box’ models curtail community involvement in
decision-making and evidence gathering; increase costs of transferring
lessons learned, leading many newcomers to ‘reinvent the wheel’; and
limit adaptation to new data sources and ideas, reducing opportunities
for innovation and participation of a wide range of stakeholders,
reducing the diversity of voices involved (Lovelace, Parkin, and Cohen
2020).


Based on these observations, and lack of strong quantitative data being
reported as a barrier preventing effective investment in cycling (Aldred
et al. 2017), this paper makes the case for free and explores the
concept of, open and participatory tools for cycle planning. Instead of
providing ready made solutions or advocating a particular methodology or
tool, we aim to generate conversations about how considerations such as
gender equality and social justice, which are often invisible to
professional transport planners, can be ‘mainstreamed’ through open
source and publicly available models. We find that although no globally
scalable free, open source and participatory planning tools for
prioritising cycling interventions down to the street level currently
exist (at the time of writing to the best of our knowledge), several
promising conceptual and software platforms on which such tools could
build already exist.

This paper discusses the desirable and technologically feasible features of such
‘open access tools’: multimodal, scenario-based, interactive, accessible
and participatory. 
The discussion shifts to practicalities and the
identification of barriers that need to be overcome before a thriving
open community of practice develops around modeling for cycling. There
are many considerations when designing transport models to evidence
effective cycling investments, including: support for user participation
in the planning process; user friendly/accessible interface designs;
levels of interactivity (including the possibility to edit maps
representing hypothetical transport futures); levels of
commercial/government involvement; and control over code and data.
Beyond technical skill, the analysis suggests that actively navigating
these flash-points and building a community may be vital for developing
successful tools for cycle planning. We conclude that there is a need
for a global, open source transport modelling community, with associated
open datasets, deeply connected to those working on participatory
governance and planning models. This paper aims to start a conversation
around this need and provides pointers based on insights from previous
projects in that direction.

## 100 word summary

Free, open and participatory planning tools are now feasible and in use
(albeit with limited geographic scope and/or functionality). This talk
will explore how such tools could help support effective vision-building
and interventions to enable cycling uptake. Building on insights from
prior projects, it will outline key features of effective open tools for
cycle planning and attempt to identify the barriers than need to be
overcome for an international community of practice in this area to
become a reality. The aim is not to present solutions but start
conversations that could lead to movement towards such a community of
practice.

- Transport models were designed to support growth in car ownership and reduce journey times (Boyce and Williams, 2015)

--

- 21^st^ Century priorities are very different

--

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

# Propensity to Cycle Tool

- Early prototype of the tool developed at Open Data Institute Leeds hackathon, 2015
- National deployment of the Propensity to Cycle Tool 2 years later ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

Can do in questions...

---

## Key aspects of the PCT

- Based on open source code
- Based on open data
- Results published as open data
- Publicly available web application encourages participation and evidence-based debate

Open data and accessible results lead to participation. See https://twitter.com/search?q=cyipt.bike%2Frapid

We can internationalise the tools, but what about extending the tools?
