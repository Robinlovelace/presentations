### Work in Active Travel England üöÄ

Head of Data and Digital (2023) Head of Data Science (2024)

???

especially in relation to ...
decarbonisation, active travel and the government's leveling-up agenda.
The government has set-out these priorities ...
<!-- the *Decarbonising transport: setting the challenge* --> <!-- ^[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-transport-decarbonisation-plan] --> <!-- report (a precursor to the forthcoming Transport Decarbonisation Plan), the *Gear Change* vision for walking and cycling, --> <!-- ^[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycling-and-walking-plan-for-england] --> <!-- and the *Levelling Up Fund* prospectus. --> <!-- ^[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-fund-prospectus] -->

#### What can data do for us?

![](https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/articles/covid.png)

???

4 main things, first 2 are well known, the second 2 are not:

-   Provide objective and persuasive information about the world and making the case for change

-   Tell or reinforce stories about change, down to the local level

-   Create a long term vision that is based on reality that we can aim towards

-   Enable more participatory and therefore democratic and successful processes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example: The Propensity to Cycle Tool

![](https://github.com/npct/pct-team/blob/master/figures/front-page-leeds-pct-demo.png?raw=true)

???

First thing to say: Ministers, and this is Chris Grayling, like digital tools, quicker than reading a PDF

The tool has influenced hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in strategic cycle networks

More than that, it's changed the way that planning happens

We can go way beyond it with a team

# Thinking about data (science)

Data science as climbing the DIKW pyramid

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DIKW_Pyramid.svg/220px-DIKW_Pyramid.svg.png")
```

???

Definitions of data science:

-   Climbing the DIKW pyramid

-   Systematic and scalable data processing

-   Statistics that is actually useful: getting shit done with data

# Example: travel to school data

### Extra: Importance of geo tools

Active travel interventions are local

Tools should be:

Accessible

Evolving

Scalable

Open
