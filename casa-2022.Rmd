### Too much data?

A nice problem to have?

Data historically a limiting factor

New approaches needed to tackle 'big noise'

- For most of the history of transport planning data scarcity has been a major concern
- Now we have an abundance of datasets, many of them incompatible
- Concrete example: OD to WPZ data in central London (could ask if anyone knows, it's a mess hehe)

### Climate change: The elephant in the room

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/4bMoVkgc8QVCQo97kw" width="480" height="208" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p>

???

What is climate change? And how does it related to open source software?


It's great to be able to talk about climate change upfront. Usually it's behind the scenes.

To solve problems you need to talk about them.

Everyone including the elephant knows that climate change means the world is getting warmer.

But fewer people talk about 'global drying' and likely impacts such as sudden sea level rise that can only be described as catastrophic

As with health, the most solutions tackle the root causes of the problem. So what is the root cause of the problem? We can go back a few steps...

Climate change is caused by emissions.

Emissions are (primarily) caused by combustion of fossil fuels

But what causes that? Energy consumption.

What causes energy use? Demand for energy intensive things, transport, manufacturing

---

## Example: Climate change, what data science can bring

.left-column[

Emotive and potentially polarising issue

Data can provide a shared starting point

Nationally scenarios are vital

Locally, visions, trust, buy-in and participation are key

<!-- <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe> -->

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
piggyback::pb_upload("annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv")
piggyback::pb_download_url("annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
emissions = readr::read_csv("https://github.com/Robinlovelace/presentations/releases/download/2020-02/annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv")
emissions = emissions %>% rename(Emissions = `Annual CO2 emissions (zero filled)`)
emissions_regions = emissions %>%
  filter(is.na(Code)) %>%
  filter(Entity != "World") %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(string = Entity, pattern = "EU|Fr|Ku|Leew|exc|Pan|Ry|St"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
g = ggplot(emissions_regions) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, Emissions, colour = Entity), show.legend = FALSE)
plotly::ggplotly(g)
```

]


???

The Downward trend during coronavirus saw emissions drop by ~10%

The scale of the challenge is to reduce emissions by 10% every year, every year, and the challenge gets hard with each year

That means: we need transformational

# Existing tools: The Propensity to Cycle Tool

- Early prototype of the tool developed at Open Data Institute Leeds hackathon, 2015
- National deployment of the Propensity to Cycle Tool 2 years later ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017)

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npct/pct-team/master/figures/early.png")
```

---

## Key aspects of the PCT

- Based on open source code
- Based on open data
- Results published as open data
- Publicly available web application encourages participation and evidence-based debate

Open data and accessible results lead to participation. See https://twitter.com/search?q=cyipt.bike%2Frapid

# Reproducibility and extending the tool

- Find commuting desire lines in West Yorkshire between 1 and 3 km long in which more people drive than cycle:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: get top 1000 lines in repo
u = "https://github.com/npct/pct-outputs-regional-notR/raw/master/commute/msoa/west-yorkshire/l.geojson"
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines_all = read_sf(u)
desire_lines = desire_lines_all %>% 
  top_n(10, all)
write_sf(desire_lines, "desire_lines.geojson")
piggyback::pb_upload("desire_lines.geojson")
```


```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Set-up, after installing R and checking out www.pct.bike:
u = "https://github.com/ITSLeeds/TDS/releases/download/0.1/desire_lines.geojson"
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
desire_lines = read_sf(u)
```

```{r}
plot(desire_lines["bicycle"])
```

     - How could active travel provision be made better?
  - Find a housing development that has poor active travel provision
      - How could active travel provision be improved, based on the data?
      - Should new houses be built in this location?

Also complexity vs simplicity and readability
