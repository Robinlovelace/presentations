::: notes
-   Hard to know how far to go back
-   Where I was born seems a good place to start, in Norton Canon
-   It wasn't this house, but was in the same location, in a photo taken in 1932. I have no idea how my dad got this photo, but it was a great find!
-   My mum and dad moved to Herefordshire in 1979
-   I was born in 1985, six years after they moved but the house still wasn't 100% finished, I may have inherited some of my dad's time optimism
-   Huge thanks to them for physically building a strong foundation for me

::: notes
-   Norton Canon is a village with around 200 people
-   It had a school, shop, pub church, post office and garage within walking distance when I was growing up but now only has two of those
-   It's remote, roughly equidistant from Hereford, Leominster and Hay on Wye
-   Although Hay on Wye is physically closer, it always felt further away because we rarely went that way, but you could feel the Welsh influence in the Black Mountains
-   I went to school in Weobley, which is a village with a primary school and secondary school, and a few shops, but not much else
-   I went to Hereford Sixth Form College in what felt like a big city at the time, but is less than a 10th the size of Leeds with around 50,000 people
-   I worked in the leisure centre in Leominster and played lots of sport

::: notes
This paper was about using new sources of data to inform models of human movement.

It was fascinating from an academic and methods perspective, and was ideal for strengthening my data science and programming skills.

But it lacked meaning for me: the dataset was on visits to museums in Leeds.
That is interesting, but not exactly life changing, or the kind of "save the world" stuff I wanted to do.

Incidentally the paper was never actually published, we submitted to a journal but never heard back.

I posted it on the arXiv and it got around 20 citations, which is not bad for a paper that was never published.
Rather than focus on publishing it elsewhere, I moved on to other things.

Morale of the story: don't give up!

## What is Transport Data Science?

### What is data science?

![](images/paste-88.png)

A field "to optimize the service contracts and maintenance intervals for industrial products"?
[@davenport2012]

"Data Science = Statistics + Machine Learning‚Äù or "Statistics + Computing + Communication + Sociology + Management"? ([Vybornova, 2025](https://en.itu.dk/Research/PhD-Programme/PhD-Defences/PhD-Defences-2025/March/Anastassia-Vybornova))

## Transport Data Science and Reproducibility

Transport data science is

-   A "discipline that allows you to transform raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge" [@wickham2023]

-   With reproducible and therefore falsifiable, scientific and scalable code.

-   For deeper understandings of and more evidence-based interventions in transport systems

Reproducibility is a continuous variable [@peng2011]
