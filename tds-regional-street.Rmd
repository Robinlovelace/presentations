Abstract: 
Data Science has emerged as an area of high and consistent growth in many sectors. High tech industries such as search engine optimisation, marketing and retail analytics have been quick to adopt new workflows. Transport has arguably been slow to adapt to the transformations towards open source software (as opposed to proprietary products that still dominate), command line and scriptable interfaces (unlike the graphical user interfaces of tools such as Excel) and code sharing and version development via platforms such as GitHub.

This talk demonstrates these new workflows, building on the [Transport chapter in the open source book Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) and experience developing and deploying data science tools that are having a real world impact on transport policy and practice. It will provide insight into how multiple geographic scales of analysis were used to develop the [Propensity to Cycle Tool](http://www.pct.bike/), which Robin developed in collaboration with colleagues from 4 universities and which is being used by dozens of Local Authorities to develop strategic cycle networks. Furthermore, a live demo of the recently release [stats19](https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/) package, which provides fast access to crash data for road safety research, will highlight the power of reproducibility and that transport data science is a practical field best discovered by doing it and collaboration using reproducible code.

## Information and data pyramids

Data science is climbing the DIKW pyramid

```

Data science *can* convert data to information and graphics but *cannot*, on its own, create knowledge, let alone wisdom

---

## A geographic availability pyramid

- Recommendations
- Build this here!

- City-specific datasets
  - Bristol cycle count data

- Hard-to-access national data

- Open international/national datasets
  - Open origin-destination data from UK Census

- Globally available, low-grade data (bottom)
  - OpenStreetMap, Elevation data

---

## An ease-of access pyramid

- Data provision packages
  - Use the pct package
  - stats19 package

- Pre-processed data
  - E.g. downloading data from website www.pct.bike

- Messy official data
  - Raw STATS19 data

---

## A geographic level of detail pyramid

- Agents
- Route networks
- Nodes
- Routes
- Desire lines
- Transport zones


---

## Observations

- Official sources are often smaller in sizes but higher in Quality

- Unofficial sources provide higher volumes but tend to be noisy, e.g.: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gean.12081

- Another way to classify data is by quality: signal/noise ratios

- Globally available datasets would be at the bottom of this pyramid; local surveys at the top.

- Which would be best to inform policy?

---

## Portals

- UK geoportal, providing geographic data at many levels: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk
- Other national geoportals exist, such as this: http://www.geoportal.org/
- A good source of cleaned origin destination data is the Region downloads tab in the Propensity to Cycle Tool - see the Region data tab for West Yorkshire here, for example: http://www.pct.bike/m/?r=west-yorkshire
- OpenStreetMap is an excellent source of geographic data with global coverage. You can download data on specific queries (e.g. highway=cycleway) from the overpass-turbo service: https://overpass-turbo.eu/ or with the **osmdata** package

---

## Online lists

For other datasets, search online! Good starting points in your research may be:

- The open data section in Geocomputation with R - https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#retrieving-data
- Transport datasets mentioned here: https://data.world/datasets/transportation
- UK government transport data: https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/publisher/department-for-transport

---

## Data packages

- The **openrouteservice** github package provides routing data
- The stats19 package can get road crash data for anywhere in Great Britain [@lovelace_stats19_2019] see here for info: https://itsleeds.github.io/stats19/
- The pct package provides access to data in the PCT: https://github.com/ITSLeeds/pct
- There are many other R packages to help access data

---

## Visualising spatial networks

```{r}
library(sf)
plot(lvn_lines["highway"])
```

---

## Highway types + data cleaning

```{r}
summary(as.factor(lvn_lines$highway))
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
# the tidyverse way:
library(dplyr)
lvn_lines = lvn_lines %>% mutate(highway2 = case_when(
  stringr::str_detect(highway, "const|corri|eleva|_link|plat|unc") ~ as.character(NA),
  TRUE ~ lvn_lines$highway
  ))
```

---

## Cleaning II

```{r}
# (a) base R way
lvn_lines_highway_table = table(lvn_lines$highway)
lvn_lines_highway_table
lvn_lines_to_remove = names(lvn_lines_highway_table)[lvn_lines_highway_table < 89]
lvn_lines_to_remove
lvn_lines$highway3 = lvn_lines$highway
lvn_lines$highway3[lvn_lines$highway3 %in% lvn_lines_to_remove] = NA
```

---

## Results...

```{r}
plot(lvn_lines %>% select(contains("high")))
```

## Mapping packages

```{r}
library(tmap)
tm_shape(lvn_lines) + tm_lines("highway3")
```

## Tools for reproducible research

Transport data science is simply the application of 'data science' to transport

- In terms of technique this means command-line tools for scalable analysis
- Principles: reproducibility, generalisability, (public) accessibility

### Example II: **stats19**

- Package providing access to open access road casualty dataset: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/

Used by the Parliamentary library to provide evidence for Members of Parliament (MPs): https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/economy-business/transport/roads/constituency-data-traffic-accidents/

---

# The practical session

It depends on you level of R skills, in ascending order of difficulty

1. Work through the Transport Chapter (12) in Geocompuation with R

2. Work through an introduction to road safety analysis with R: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training.html

3. Apply the methods in that chapter to a different UK city (advanced)

4. Have a play with the OSM data for Louvain-la-Neuve, hosted in the releases page of https://github.com/Robinlovelace/presentations (easy-to-hard)
  - Visualise the dataset with tmap and other packages (see Chapter 8)
  - Undertake spatial network analysis of the data (advanced, see sfnetworks package)
  - Devise your own research questions using available data (PhD!)
5. Technical issues: how to convert road network into polygons (see https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr/issues/362 ), how to do 'kriging' on a spatial network (see https://github.com/luukvdmeer/sfnetworks/issues/11 )

<!-- specific stats - kriging on network -->

<!-- geo question -->
