This housing estate in Bicester illustrates the problem: it's called the Bicester Eco-Town so you'd be forgiven for thinking that it has a low environmental impact

A picture can tell a thousand words but it still can be deceptive: we need a more objective view of things

#### Marketting vs Reality

When planning officers are presented with a proposal it is often difficult to evaluate sustainability claims

Guidance and objective measures are scarce, meaning that intuition is often used

What we need is an object evidence base

Why are housing developments being approved in places like this at a time of climate crises?

Governments must meet multiple competing objectives

The August 2020 planning white paper outlined the need to create beautiful places and provide housing

A House of [Commons Research Briefing](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7671/) from January 2021 outlined the challenge of increasing housing supply to meet the aim of building 300k houses per year

The July 2021 Decarbonising transport paper set out dramatic policies for the sector with rapid uptake of walking and cycling: "We will aim to have 
half of all journeys 
in towns and cities 
cycled or walked"

And in the 2021 Gear Change one year on policy paper, the prime minister said in the foreword

"I support councils, of all parties, which are trying to promote cycling and bus
use. And if you are going to oppose these schemes, you must tell us what
your alternative is, because trying to squeeze more cars and delivery vans
on the same roads and hoping for the best is not going to work."

As we've seen the problem is largely political but it has has a substantial technical component

The 'tools of the trade' 

  - Climate science, air pollution and health force a shift in focus
  - The concepts of 'participatory democracy' and 'citizen science' mean there is a need for collaborative solutions

Despite substantial academic work on integrated land-use transport models and an entire academic journal dedicated to it

Planning and transport not always joined up

## The ActDev tool

4 month UKRI funded project on high impact research in transport/planning

Publicly available tool with maps and data on active travel levels, potential and provision

## Stakeholder mapping

- Professional planners: Lynda Addison, Lead on planning and transport integration, Transport Planning Society

- Active travel planners: Julian Sanchez, Active Travel, Programme Manager, Essex County Council, Kit Allwinter, Active Travel Officer West Yorkshire Combined Authority

- Consultants, e.g. Lucy Taussig, Consultant, Active Travel

- Local Authority Planning Officers

- NGOs, e.g. Megan Streb, Partnership Manager, Sustrans

- The wider public

---

## Research findings

- Median distance to town centre is 3.2 km only three within 2.0 km
- **14%** of trips made by active travel around 35 sample site locations compared with **14% nationwide**
- Provision of good infrastructure varies considerably

## Possible next steps

.pull-left[

- Review of stakeholder needs, engagement with relative parties, e.g. DfT, DLUHC, [BEIS](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy), [CCC](https://www.theccc.org.uk/), the nascent [Active Travel England](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/338-million-package-to-further-fuel-active-travel-boom), local authority planning officers, and more

- Additional data sources

- Improve modelling to include more explanatory variables

- Refine treatment of walking

- Additional trip purposes

- Scale up nationally

- Training, outreach, maintenance

Our open source and agile development process allows anyone to suggest additions

We have already added three more sites following popular demand, there is demand for more

- Transport models have a huge impact on transport planning
- More people with access to good data -> better outcomes
