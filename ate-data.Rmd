The UK is a global leader in not only open access data and data science

We have a huge amount to offer and I know of people coming here from the USA, usually the brain drain goes in the opposite direction!

#### What can data do for us?

![](https://saferactive.github.io/trafficalmr/articles/covid.png)

![](https://a-b-street.github.io/docs/project/history/retrospective/edit_roads.gif)

???

4 main things, first 2 are well known, the second 2 are not:

- Provide objective and persuasive information about the world and making the case for change

- Tell or reinforce stories about change, down to the local level

- Create a long term vision that is based on reality that we can aim towards

- Enable more participatory and therefore democratic and successful processes

---

# Example: The Propensity to Cycle Tool

![](https://github.com/npct/pct-team/blob/master/figures/front-page-leeds-pct-demo.png?raw=true)

???

First thing to say: Ministers, and this is Chris Grayling, like digital tools, quicker than reading a PDF

The tool has influenced hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in strategic cycle networks

More than that, it's changed the way that planning happens

We can go way beyond it with a team

# Thinking about data (science)

Data science as climbing the DIKW pyramid

knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/DIKW_Pyramid.svg/220px-DIKW_Pyramid.svg.png")

Definitions of data science:

- Climbing the DIKW pyramid

- Systematic and scalable data processing

- Statistics that is actually useful: getting shit done with data
